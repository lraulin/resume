## Objective Statement

Dedicated, disciplined, and athletic self-taught programmer 8+ years of experience as an English as a Second Language teacher in Korea and one year of experience as a web developer working under contract for the US Department of Transportation.

## Professional Qualifications

Extremely motivated and passionate life-long learner. Have been using Linux as primary operating system for almost a decade. Learned Python as a hobby, and learned how to use Vim because it seemed neat. After deciding to become a programmer, I spent a year of full-time practice/self-study before being accepted by WOS. In the year since then, my skills with JavaScript and Python have continued to develop, as I have become familiar with the languages in depth and used them to create solutions to real-world problems.
