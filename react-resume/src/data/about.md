# About Me

I am a self-taught programmer with two years of experience: one paid as a DoT
contractor, and one of full-time self-directed study.

JavaScript/Python developer. As a contractor at the DoT, I created a web app
with React, Node/Express, and Postgres, to be deployed via AWS. I also created
multiple scripts/apps (in Python, Bash, and Node) to assist the cybersecurity
team by automating various tasks, processing data and sending it to the
appropriate people, etc.

In a former life, I was an English teacher in Korea for a decade, and before
that, I was a boatswain's mate in the US Coast Guard. I also have a master's
degree in psychology.

My hobbies include reading (nonfiction), fitness (Indian clubs, functional
strength, yoga, kayaking, natural movement, etc), and camping.
